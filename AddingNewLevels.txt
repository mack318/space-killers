Instructions for making a new version
=====================================

If you have any questions, comments or proposals for making versions, please
contact us at:

Making a new version of Space Killers requires an image-making or image-modifing
program such as Photoshop or Gimp. All the sound files need to be saved as
*.ogg files and all image files need to be saved as *.png files.

You will need to add files to the folders:
    "SpKillers" and "Spkillers/versions"

You will need to modify the file: "versions.txt"

Naming your version
-------------------

You will need to add your version's name to the file: "versions.txt". Write the
name on a new line in the file. Make sure you leave a trailing whitespace at the
end of your new name.

If you want your version to appear before another, write it just above its
name.

The name of your version must correspond exactly to the name of your text box.
(This part is explained next)

Making a text box
------------------

The text box is the image that a player sees in the menu and can click to play
the version.

There is a maximum limit of versions before the versions will notbe visible on
the screen.

Your text box must be 120x50 pixels. You must save your text box as a *.png file
inside the folder "versions".


Images for invaders
--------------------

All the new images for invaders must be saved in a new folder sharing the name
of your version. This folder should be a subfolder of the folder "SpKillers".

There are three types of invaders. Each of these requires a specific number
of images and specific image names.
All the images for invaders must be *.png type files.
All the images for the invaders must be 45x30 pixels.

For the simple, easy invader, you need to save one image as: "invader.png"

For the second, harder invader, you need to save two images. one will be the
invader without damage and the second will be the invader once it has been shot
once.
The first image should be saved as: "invader2.png"
The second image should be saved as: "invader2Hit1.png"

For the second, hardest invader, you need to save three images. One for the
invader without damage, the second will be the invader shot once and the
third will be the invader shot twice.
The first image should be saved as: "invader3.png"
The second image should be saved as: "invader3Hit1.png"
The third image should be saved as: "invader3Hit2.png"


Image for your Avatar
----------------------

The avatar image needs to be saved in the same folder as your invaders.

The image for your Avatar must be *.png type files.
The image for your Avatar must be 45x30 pixels.

The Avatar image needs to be saved as: "Avatar.png"



Music for your version
-----------------------

To add to the ambience of your version, you need to choose a music that will
play during the game.

The maximum time for your music is 3:00 minutes. A music longer than this will
cause the game tu run slowly.

Save your music in the same folder as your invaders.
Save your music as: "PlayMusic.ogg"
